A VR game controlled by EEG signals
# NeuroVR Game Demo

A VR game that uses EEG signals to control the speed of time.  
This project is built with Unity, Muse 2 (EEG), and Python for brain signal analysis.

## Technologies Used:
- **Unity** (for VR development)
- **Python** (for EEG data analysis and communication with Unity)
- **Muse 2 EEG Headset** (for collecting brain signals)
- **Matplotlib** (for visualizing EEG signals)

## Objective:
The goal of the game is to use the mind to slow down or speed up the flow of time. As the user relaxes or concentrates, the game dynamically adjusts the time speed in real-time.

## How to Use:
1. Ensure you have **Unity** and **Python** installed on your computer.
2. Connect your **Muse 2 EEG Headset**.
3. Clone this repository to your local environment.
4. Run the Unity project to start the game.
5. Run the Python script to receive EEG data and send it to Unity.

## Setup:
1. Download and install Unity from the [official Unity website](https://unity.com/).
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
